/**
 * ## Overview
 *
 * The Controller class is responsible for taking in requests from the outside
 * world and returning the appropriate response.
 *
 * Think of a Controller as a server at a restaurant. A client makes a request
 * to an application, that request is routed to the appropriate Controller and
 * then the Controller interprets the request and returns data relative to what
 * the client has request.
 *
 * #### Actions
 *
 * Controller actions are functions that call on a Controller in response to an
 * incoming HTTP request. The job of Controller actions are to return the data
 * that the Lux Application will respond with.
 *
 * There is no special API for Controller actions. They are simply functions
 * that return a value. If an action returns a Query or Promise the resolved
 * value will be used rather than the immediate return value of the action.
 *
 * Below you will find a table showing the different types of responses you can
 * get from different action return values. Keep in mind, Lux is agnostic to
 * whether or not the value is returned synchronously or resolved from a
 * Promise.
 *
 * | Return/Resolved Value        | Response                                   |
 * |------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
 * | Array<Model> or Model        | Serialized JSON String                     |
 * | Array or Object Literal      | JSON String                                |
 * | String Literal               | Plain Text                                 |
 * | Number Literal               | [HTTP Status Code](https://goo.gl/T2lMc7)  |
 * | true                         | [204 No Content](https://goo.gl/GxKoqz)    |
 * | false                        | [401 Unauthorized](https://goo.gl/60QqCW)  |
 *
 * **Built-In Actions**
 *
 * Built-in actions refer to Controller actions that you get for free when
 * extending the Controller class (show, index, create, update, destroy). These
 * actions are highly optimized to load only the attributes and relationships
 * that are defined in the resolved Serializer for a Controller.
 *
 * If applicable, built-in actions support the following features described in
 * the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/):
 *
 * - [Sorting](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sorting)
 * - [Filtering](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-filtering)
 * - [Pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination)
 * - [Sparse Fieldsets](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets)
 * - [Including Related Resources](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes)
 *
 * **Extending Built-In Actions**
 *
 * Considering the amount of functionality built-in actions provide, you will
 * rarely need to override the default behavior of a built-in action. In the
 * event that you do need to override a built-in action, you have the ability to
 * opt back into the built-in logic by calling the super class.
 *
 * Read actions such as index and show return a Query which allows us to chain
 * methods to the super call. In the following example  we will extend the
 * default behavior of the index action to only match records that meet an
 * additional hard-coded set of conditions. We will still be able to use all of
 * the functionality that the built-in index action provides.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // app/controllers/posts.js
 * import { Controller } from 'lux-framework';
 *
 * class PostsController extends Controller {
 *    index(request, response) {
 *      return super.index(request, response).where({
 *        isPublic: true
 *      });
 *    }
 *  }
 *
 *  export default PostsController;
 * ```
 *
 * **Custom Actions**
 *
 * Sometimes it is necessary to add a custom action to a Controller. Lux allows
 * you to do so by adding an instance method to a Controller. In the following
 * example you will see how to add a custom action with the name `check` to a
 * Controller. We are implementing this action to use as a health check for the
 * application so we want to return the `Number` literal `204`.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // app/controllers/health.js
 * import { Controller } from 'lux-framework';
 *
 * class HealthController extends Controller {
 *   async check() {
 *     return 204;
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * export default HealthController;
 * ```
 *
 * The example above is nice but we can make the code a bit more concise with an
 * Arrow `Function`.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // app/controllers/health.js
 * import { Controller } from 'lux-framework';
 *
 * class HealthController extends Controller {
 *   check = async () => 204;
 * }
 *
 * export default HealthController;
 * ```
 *
 * Using an Arrow Function instead of a traditional method Controller can be
 * useful when immediately returning a value. However, there are a few downsides
 * to using an Arrow `Function` for a Controller action, such as not being able
 * to call the `super class`. This can be an issue if you are looking to extend
 * a built-in action.
 *
 * Another use case for a custom action could be to return a specific scope of
 * data from a `Model`. Let's implement
 * a custom `drafts` route on a `PostsController`.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // app/controllers/posts.js
 * import { Controller } from 'lux-framework';
 * import Post from 'app/models/posts';
 *
 * class PostsController extends Controller {
 *   drafts() {
 *     return Post.where({
 *       isPublic: false
 *     });
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * export default PostsController;
 * ```
 *
 * While the example above works, we would have to implement all the custom
 * logic that we get for free with built-in actions. Since we aren't getting too
 * crazy with our custom action we can likely just call the `index` action and
 * chain a `.where()` to it.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // app/controllers/posts.js
 * import { Controller } from 'lux-framework';
 *
 * class PostsController extends Controller {
 *   drafts(request, response) {
 *     return this.index(request, response).where({
 *       isPublic: false
 *     });
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * export default PostsController;
 * ```
 *
 * Now we can sort, filter, and paginate our custom `drafts` route!
 *
 * #### Middleware
 *
 * Middleware can be a very powerful tool in many Node.js server frameworks. Lux
 * is no exception. Middleware can be used to execute logic before or after a
 * Controller action is executed.
 *
 * There are two hooks where you can execute middleware functions,
 * `beforeAction` and `afterAction`. Functions added to the `beforeAction` hook
 * will execute before the Controller action and functions added to the
 * `afterAction` hook will be executed after the `Controller` action.
 *
 * **Context**
 *
 * Middleware functions will be bound to the Controller they are added to upon
 * the start of an Application.
 *
 * Due to the lexical binding of arrow functions, if you need to use the `this`
 * keyword within a middleware function, declare the middleware function using
 * the `function` keyword and not as an arrow function.
 *
 * **Scoping Middleware**
 *
 * Middleware is scoped by Controller and includes a parent Controller's
 * middleware recursively until the parent Controller is the root
 * `ApplicationController`. This allows you to implement custom logic that can
 * be executed for resources, namespaces, or an entire Application.
 *
 * Let's say we want to require authentication for every route in our
 * Application. All we have to do is move our authentication middleware function
 * from the example above to the `ApplicationController`.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // app/controllers/application.js
 * import { Controller } from 'lux-framework';
 *
 * class ApplicationController extends Controller {
 *   beforeAction = [
 *     async function authenticate(request) {
 *       if (!request.currentUser) {
 *         // 401 Unauthorized
 *         return false;
 *       }
 *     }
 *   ];
 * }
 *
 * export default ApplicationController;
 * ```
 *
 * **Execuation Order**
 *
 * Understanding the execution order of middleware functions and a `Controller`
 * action is essential to productivity with Lux. Depending on what you use case
 * is, you may want your function to execute at different times in the
 * `request` / `response` cycle.
 *
 * 1. Parent `Controller` `beforeAction` hooks
 * 2. `Controller` `beforeAction` hooks
 * 3. `Controller` Action
 * 4. `Controller` `afterAction` hooks
 * 5. Parent `Controller` `afterAction` hooks
 *
 * **Modules**
 *
 * It is considered a best practice to define your middleware functions in
 * separate file and export them for use throughout an Application. Typically
 * this is done within an `app/middleware` directory.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // app/middleware/authenticate.js
 * export default async function authenticate(request) {
 *   if (!request.currentUser) {
 *     // 401 Unauthorized
 *     return false;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This keeps the Controller code clean, easier to read, and easier to modify.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // app/controllers/application.js
 * import { Controller } from 'lux-framework';
 * import authenticate from 'app/middleware/authenticate';
 *
 * class ApplicationController extends Controller {
 *   beforeAction = [
 *     authenticate
 *   ];
 * }
 *
 * export default ApplicationController;
 * ```
